Origami-Scavenger hunt challenge where we find animals, fold that animal, and take a picture with it. The more 
animals, the more people you teach in your group, the more points you get! Also, bonus points if you teach other people
(outside of the club) to fold! Winner is...Group Tammy, Holly, Tomomi and Nick! Congratulations!
