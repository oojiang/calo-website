# Who are we?
We are students of UC Berkeley who want to spread the joy of folding origami! We hold weekly club meetings for students
of all experience levels to chill out and destress by folding cool origami. We also host the annual East Bay Origami 
Convention (aka EBOC) for people to come together to fold, share, and show off origami, and also get to meet some 
world-class folders from the Bay Area. We're also proud to teach the Origami DeCal, which teaches students how to fold
origami, shape models to express their creativity, and design origami models from scratch. We welcome you, whether you've
never folded origami in your life or you're a grizzled origami veteran, to come fold origami with us at our club meetings,
convention, and DeCal!
